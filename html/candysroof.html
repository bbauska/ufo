It is a waterproof or water-resistant barrier material that is installed on the roof deck. The material goes directly underneath the roof and stands as a protective shield against severe weather.
</blockquote>
<quote>
If your roof develops a crack, you can rest easy because this underlayment will prevent further damage.
</quote>
<br><br>
<h4>There are three types of underlayments:</h4>
<ol class="c">
<li>Rubberized Asphalt Underlayment (waterproof *)</li>
<li>Asphalt-Saturated Felt Underlayment (water-resistant *)</li>
<li>Non-Bitumen Synthetic Underlayment (water-resistant *)</li>
</ol>
The first underlayment is <i>waterproof</i>, while the remaining two are water-resistant.
<br>
<p>
*Note: Most people are confused regarding the difference between water-resistant and waterproof. The former term (water-resistant) means that the underlayment can withstand water, but only for a certain period of time. On the other, the latter term (waterproof) means that the underlayment is completely protected from water.
</p>
<!------- wsu #1 rubberized asphalt --------->
<!------------------------------------------->
<!--- <ol type="c">   -->
<h5>1. Rubberized Asphalt Underlayment</h5>
<p>
Rubberized asphalt contains rubber polymers and asphalt. Amongst the three underlayments, it is the most expensive one because it is waterproof.

This underlayment is like a sticky paper. Before this underlayment is applied, its back membrane is removed. The sticky material is what acts as a waterproof seal. It also protects the roof edges from causing leaks. This material proves pretty beneficial in areas such as roof protrusions and valleys on the roof.
</p>
<h6>Pros</h6>
<ul class="d">
<li>The only Waterproof material for this type of job.</li>
<li>Low installation cost: It may be expensive, but it is easy to apply.</li>
<li>Longevity: Rubberized asphalt comes in rolls, which means there are few seams. This lowers the chances of water entering the attic. This underlayment can last for 50 years.</li>
<li>UV resistant: It is resistant to the sun’s ultraviolet rays.</li>
<li>Durable: Compared to pure asphalt, rubber does not crack, expand, or contract due to weather changes.</li>
<li>Easy to repair: A special type of tape is used for repairing any tears in the rubber. This usually does the trick.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Cons</h6>
<ul class="d">
<li>Rubberized underlayment comes in many forms. Some are resistant to fire and some are not.
You need a professional to install this underlayment, which can add to the cost.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<!---------- wsu #2 asphalt felt ------------>
<!------------------------------------------->
<h5>2. Asphalt-Saturated Felt Underlayment</h5>
<p>
Known as “tar paper,” this underlayment is made from varying blends of polyester, bitumen, cellulose, or asphalt. It is one of the most common materials used in older houses and usually comes in two different thicknesses:  15-pound and 30-pound. The 30-pound thickness is obviously more resistant to damage and will last longer (see video below):
</p>
<p>
Asphalt saturated felt is not recommended in areas where it frequently rains. The price of felt varies and mostly depends on the amount of asphalt in it. The more the asphalt content in the underlayment, the more durable and costly it will be.
</p>
<h6>Pros</h6>
<ul class="d">
<li>Budget-friendly</li>
<li>Contains fiberglass, which increases its durability and strength.</li>
<li>Good for low slope roofs as water will slide away easily.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Cons</h6>
<ul class="d">
<li>Weighs more than rubberized asphalt underlayment and non-bitumen synthetic underlayment.</li>
<li>Installation is pretty costly.</li>
<li>Degrades pretty easily if exposed to external environment.</li>
<li>Vulnerable to sun damage.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<!------------ wsu #3 synthetic ------------->
<!------------------------------------------->
<h5>3. Non-Bitumen Synthetic Underlayment</h5>
<p>
This synthetic underlayment contains asphalt, along with fiberglass, polyethylene and polypropylene. These three materials give it superior stability and make it resistant to tears. Some manufacturers, add a slip resistance material to it, which protects it from water.
</p>
<h6>Pros</h6>
<ul class="d">
<li>Long lasting and durable.</li>
<li>Lightweight</li>
<li>Prevents water leaks and ice dams.</li>
<li>Fungus resistant.</li>
<li>Is not vulnerable to direct UV radiation.</li>
<li>Easy and safe to install.</li>
</ul>
<h6>Cons</h6>
<ul class="d">
<li>Depending on the materials used in the manufacturing, it can be very expensive, which is its biggest and only drawback.</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>
To conclude, if you are installing a new roof, we (contractors) would suggest that you choose Rubberized Asphalt underlayment. Yes, it is a little more on the expensive (like triple!!!) side but it will outlast the other material types and will surely protect your house from water leaks, mold and mildew.
</p>
<p>
Actually, I personally would choose the Non-Bitumen Synthetic Underlayment made by Owens-Corning.  It just seems like a better value.  Perhaps in Seattle where it rains a shit-load, Rubberized Asphalt Underlayment would be the choice.  But here in Central Washington State, it's a no-brainer.  Non-Bitmen Synthetic Underlament.

<article>
<p>
As a roofing contractor doing business in my hometown for more than 20 years, I consider it my obligation to give customers the best value for their money. When their asphalt shingle roof has reached the end of its life, most people assume their only option is to strip the roof to bare sheathing before a new roof can be applied. But unless the sheathing is extensively damaged or the structure can't support the weight of another layer of roofing, a better solution is to apply a new layer of shingles right over the old one. Done correctly, a reroof job will look as good and last as long as a "new" roof, for a lot less money and a lot less hassle.
</p>
<h5>Advantages of Reroofing</h5>
<p>
Most building codes allow two layers of organic or fiberglass asphalt shingles on roofs with a 4/12 pitch or less, and three layers on steeper roofs. If the structure can support the added weight, a typical 20-square (2,000-square-foot) reroof will cost at least $1,000 less than a tear-off job. Labor savings go beyond demolition: Not having to lay down felt paper saves $10 a square; and site and weather protection, as well as cleanup, are all reduced if not eliminated.
</p>
<p>
Disposal costs are lower, too, because we don't have to rent a dumpster and we save the $65-per-ton dump fees. We also save by not having to separate the recyclables. Here in central New York, asphalt, cardboard, and wood all have to be tossed into different containers, and in some cases hauled to different transfer stations. The same is true of flashing, drip edge, tar buckets, vents, and other scrap metal.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Less liability.</i></b> As a contractor in a highly competitive business, I can't claim that a reroof is a lot more profitable than a tear-off job, but I can say that it's much less risky. There is no chance of a dumpster carving up the lawn or scarring the driveway; there is less risk of property damage from falling debris or from nails that find their way into homeowners' car tires. And because bare sheathing is never exposed to the elements, there is much less chance of weather damage or of an employee being injured while scrambling around in the rain trying to get an exposed roof under cover.
</p>
<p>
<b><i>Equal quality.</i></b> All shingle manufacturers honor the warranty, whether their products are used for a reroof or a new roof. If the job is done correctly, with the new layer of shingles laid flat over the existing shingles, the old roof cushions the new one and serves as a secondary barrier should wind or water ever break through the new shingles.
</p>
<h5>Evaluating the Job</h5>
<p>
Because my company does both tear-off and reroof work, I evaluate each job to determine which procedure is best. Whenever I'm called to give a roofing estimate, I always ask the callers to tell me why they think they need a new roof. Have they noticed leaks and stains, or is it simply because their neighbors are replacing their roofs? I also ask about the age and apparent condition of the roof. If the roof is, say, eight years old, it probably just needs a repair. If it's 15 years old and they've noticed loose granules washing off the shingles or running out of the downspouts, it's a reroof candidate. When they tell me what neighborhood they're in, I can also make a good guess about how many layers of shingles are already on the roof.
</p>
<p>
<p>
When I arrive to inspect the site, the first thing I look at is not the roof but the condition of the house and the quality of any recent work that might have been done to it. We do high quality work and we charge more than the average fly-by-nighter. If a house looks like no one cares, I want to find out what kind of work the owners are looking for before I invest a lot of my time.
</p>
<p>
I always walk the roof. A contractor who only does tear-off work can figure a job standing on the ground with a tape measure and a pair of binoculars. Not me. I can't be sure that reroofing will work until I've thoroughly inspected every inch of the roof. Sometimes it's an easy decision: If I peel the shingles back from the rake edge and count three or more layers, and if most of the shingles are badly curled, the permanent step flashing is badly deteriorated, or the deck feels soft and spongy wherever I step, it needs a tear-off.
</p>
<p>
Even if the structure can support the added weight, the new roof won't last unless it's laid flat over smooth shingles, intact flashing, and sound sheathing. Localized problems, like a few missing shingles or one or two soft spots in the sheathing — at the mouth of a valley, for example, or around pipes or at the bottom of the chimney — can be easily repaired, but beyond that it's more efficient to do a complete tear-off. I also rule out reroofing if a careless prior reshingling has left the roof with a washboard surface.
</p>
<p>
If reroofing is warranted, I measure the existing shingles to determine whether they're standard (12x36 inches) or metric (13x39 inches). The new shingles must be the same size as the old ones or installation will be a nightmare. While I'm on the roof, I also measure the exposure of the existing shingle courses and eyeball their horizontal straightness. If the old roofing is extremely wavy or if the exposure varies more than 1/4 inch from the standard 5 inches (55/8 inches for metric shingles), I won't be able to follow the existing lines, so I'll have to allow more labor time for snapping chalk lines and using gauges to ensure a first-rate job.
</p>
<h5>Prep Work</h5>
<p>
The best thing about beginning a reroof job is the sound sleep I get the night before, because I don't have to worry about everything that could go wrong between tear-off and dry-in. Even if a freak thunderstorm should strike without warning, there's no need to panic. We just calmly seek shelter until the storm passes, then get right back to work. Any rainwater that gets between the new surface and the old will evaporate.
</p>
<p>
The average reroof requires at least two full pallets of shingles, which I have delivered a few days before the job starts. For a nominal additional charge, some of my suppliers will place the bundles on the roof and scatter them according to my instructions. When I can't get rooftop delivery, I coordinate with the homeowners and give my supplier specific instructions about where to place the load. I don't want the homeowner coming home from work to find 60 bundles of shingles blocking the garage.
</p>
<p>
I like to use a five-man crew for reroof jobs: a crew chief, two roofing mechanics, one laborer, and one laborer-trainee. While the other guys are unloading, setting up ladders, and stocking the roof, the crew chief will walk the perimeter of the house looking for anything fragile that might need to be moved or protected. He'll also be on the lookout for pre-existing damage that the homeowners might not have noticed. If he finds a loose railing or a cracked basement window, he'll let them know about it so we don't take the blame later on.
</p>
<p>
Because we're not doing major demolition, we don't have to take the elaborate site-protection measures I insist on when we do tear-offs. We will, however, lay plywood over air conditioning units and over any flat stepping stones that might get scratched. We've also learned the hard way to always protect expensive plants with a plywood tent, and to lay sheets of cardboard under any of our vehicles parked in the driveway to catch oil leaks.
</p>
<p>
After the roof is stocked, the laborers pry up several layers of cap shingles at a time and toss them into plastic trash bins (see Figure 1).
</p>
<!--

Figure 1. 
The roofing crew uses a Red Ripper roofing demolition tool to pry up cap shingles, which are collected in a plastic bin, along with old boot flanges and any loose shingle tabs.
-->
<p>
Sometimes they use a standard gardener's "potato fork," but the best tool for the job is a Red Ripper (Integrated Roofing Technologies, 2413 Stevenage Dr., Unit 11, Ottawa, Ontario K1G 3W1 800/352-6147). They also pry up and discard the old vent flanges, and start new boot flanges over the tops of the pipes. At this point, the prep crew also cuts out and replaces any bad sheathing, and fills in any missing shingles with scrap pieces to give the roof a sound, uniform surface. Finally, they'll use a hook blade to cut back the bottom 2 inches from the third course of existing shingles (12 inches up from the drip edge). This will make starter course layout easier.
</p>
<p>
After the messy work is done and the trash bins have been emptied into the back of the company pickup truck, the roof is swept clean, then drip edge is scattered along the perimeter of the roof and nailed in place. We use a special drip edge, called Overhang Drip (model DE6, Caliber Metals, 23500 John Gorsuch Dr., Clinton Township, MI 48036; 810/465-7650), which is made to fit over the old drip edge and shingles (Figure 2).
</p>
<!-- roof2a.jpg (10441 bytes)	Figure 2.  -->
<p>
Depending on the type of job, the author uses several specialty drip edge profiles, including one with an extra-long leg designed to cover existing shingles and drip edge (at right in top photo). A single length of drip edge wraps roof corners, with the rake flashing overlapping the eaves for good drainage (bottom).
</p>
<!-- roof2b.jpg (15146 bytes) -->
<p>
We run the metal along the eaves first, then up the rake edges, always lapping a higher piece over a lower one for good drainage.
</p>
<p>
While this is happening, one of the laborers separates the bundles of shingles into thirds and scatters them on the roof. This puts the shingles within easy reach of the shinglers, who won't lose time hunting and reaching for fresh material. The other laborer makes all the precut shingles we'll need later: inverts, one- and two-tab shingles, and caps. An invert is the 5-inch-wide top half of a full shingle; caps are one-tab shingles with the top corners tapered to ensure the exposed edges follow a straight line.

<p>
If conditions are right, new shingles laid over old shingles can be just as attractive and durable as shingles laid on bare sheathing.
Installation is easier than for a tear-off job because you can use the existing shingles as guides for laying the new ones. But you must
take care to install shingles correctly so they lie flat. And a good job involves installing new flashings rather than relying on the existing ones.
</p>
<p>
Reroof jobs are sometimes done without replacing flashings. However installing new flashings, including special drip-edge flashings made for reroofing, will ensure a tight seal and a long life. Some roofers install a layer of waterproof shingle underlayment (WSU) over the existing shingles at the eave end, as would be done for a roof laid on bare sheathing. This provides added protection against ice dams.

Asphalt shingles can be laid over cedar shakes or shingles, however, this is a roofing project best left to pros. Beveled wood pieces called "horsefeathers" must be laid along the thick edges of the shakes to make a fairly flat surface. Before you reshingle a roof, read our step-by-step guide for adding new shingles over old ones.
</p>
Even before installing the starter strip or underlayment you should install drip edge flashing along all roof edges.

Next install a course of shingles cut down to 10 inches wide, so they fit against the bottom edge of the existing third course (this creates a new 3-inch first course). After that, shingling should proceed normally, fitting each course up against the bottom of an existing course.

<h3 id="roofing-basics">Roofing Basics in 15 Easy Steps</h3>

<h4>Step 1: Remove Caps</h4>
Remove the ridge caps. Doing it now will make it easier to keep the reroofing job clean. Use a flat pry bar or roofing shovel to pry out and
remove the ridge shingles. Remove all nails.
<br>

<h4>Step 2: Remove Obstructions</h4>
Remove air vents and pipe flashings by prying out or unscrewing the fasteners holding the fixture. If you damage shingles while doing this, repair the shingles (see next step). Reuse a vent or flashing only if it is like new; otherwise, replace it with a new one that will fit the hole or pipe.
<br>

<h4>Step 3: Repair Broken Shingles</h4>
If a shingle is torn or cracked, glue the broken piece back in place using roofing cement. If the broken piece is lost, cut a new piece to fit the existing shingle. The goal is to provide a reasonably flat surface for the new shingles to lie over, with no gaps greater than 1/2 inch.
<br>

<h4>Step 4: Sweep the Roof</h4>
Using a large broom, brush away all broken shingle pieces, twigs, and any other debris that could become trapped under the new shingles that you install. Keep the roof clean as you work.
<br>

<h4>Step 5: Install Flashing</h4>
At the eave and the rake, install U-shape drip-edge flashing made for reroof jobs. Install the eave piece first, then the rake piece over it.
The two pieces should meet neatly at the corners. Drive nails at high points on the underlying roof, the bottoms of the shingles.
<br>

<h4>Step 6: Install Valley Flashing</h4>
If you have an open valley, install new W-shape metal or vinyl valley flashing to fit directly over the old flashing. Attach it by driving nails into the outside edges only. Do not drive nails less than 6 inches from the center of the flashing.
<br>
<h4>Step 7: Install Starter Strip</h4>

Use a starter strip or cut pieces for a starter course. Rip-cut the starter strip or starter pieces so that they butt up against the second course of existing shingles and are even with the front edge of the existing roofing. Attach with nails along the top edge of the strip.
<br>

<h4>Step 8: Cut and Install Shingles</h4>
Rip-cut the shingles for the first course so they butt up against the third course of existing shingles and are even with the front edge of the starter course. Their tab slots should not line up with the tab slots of the starter course, if there are any. Nail the shingles just above the tab slots.
<br>
Editor's Tip: The thicker the new shingle, the better it will hide any imperfections in the roofing below. It's a good idea to use at least 40-year shingles; architectural shingles are an even better choice.
<br>

<h4>Step 9: Continue Installing Shingles</h4>
Butt the succeeding courses of shingles against the bottoms of existing shingles and apply them by driving nails above the tab slots. Snap
vertical control lines; there is no need to snap horizontal lines. Be sure the new tab slots do not align with the old ones.
<br>

<h4>Step 10: Work Around Vent</h4>
Once you have installed shingles just past a plumbing vent, install the flashing piece so it will lie on top of roofing at its bottom but
be covered with roofing at its top. Depending on the width of the pipe, you may need to tear away a segment or two of the rubber boot.
Apply roofing cement, slide the flashing over the pipe, and push so it lies flat on the roof.
<br>

<h4>Step 11: Install Air Vents</h4>
Install air vents in a similar manner. For both plumbing-vent flashing and air vents, you'll need to cut the shingle above to go around
the flashing and then install the shingle.
<br>

<h4>Step 12: Work Around Walls</h4>
Where you meet a chimney or side wall, install step flashing. Apply a shingle, then a piece of flashing, then a shingle, and so on, so
that each piece of flashing rests on top of the lower course and is covered by the upper course. You'll need to pry the siding outward to
slip in the flashing; in some cases, you'll have to remove the siding.
<br>

<h4>Step 13: Install Counterflashing</h4>
Protect the step flashing with counterflashing. On a chimney, use a grinder to cut an indentation into the mortar. Cut and bend the
counterflashing to fit snugly into the cut mortar and to cover at least 3 inches of the step flashing. Apply mortar with a caulking
gun and set the flashing into the mortar.
<br>

<h4>Step 14: Cover Ridge</h4>
Install roofing on both sides of a ridge and cut them so they butt closely together but do not overlap. Cut shingles into ridgecaps.
Snap lines on either side and install the caps.
<br>

<h4>Step 15: Cut Shingles</h4>
At the rake, snap a line directly above the edge of the existing shingles. Cut with a utility knife; you might want to use a straightedge.
You might find it easier if you first cut from below using the existing shingles as a cutting guide.

<h4><a id="6-step-guide">Basic Step-by-Step Guide on How to Re-shingle a Roof</a></h4>
<ol class="c">
You may follow this step-by-step guide on how to reshingle a roof. This is best executed by professionals so make sure to contact a trusted roofer for assistance.
On the other hand, it is also good to know the process for your own guidance as a property owner.
<li>Step #1: Inspect your damaged roof</li>
Conduct inspections of the house or building internal parts. Look for leaks, dark spots, or water stains on ceilings and walls. Then on the outside, see if
there are cracked, curled, or missing shingles. You may also discover plant growth like molds or algae. Doing this will show you exact areas where re-shingling
is needed.
Basic Step-by-Step Guide on How to Re-shingle a Roof Getting to your roof is a tricky job and should be done with all safety measures. As we have stated, the
general rule is to have a roofing professional assess any kind of damage before you proceed with re-roofing or re-shingling.
 <li>Step #2: Remove or conceal broken shingles</li>
When you have successfully identified which shingles should be replaced, it is now the time to prep the area where you will place them. Remove old and damaged
shingles by carefully lifting them up one by one. Clear the area by brushing off any excess product. If you see holes, you also need to conceal them by nailing
aluminum flashing. This will cover it completely to prevent penetration of moisture.
 <li>Step #3: Install roofing felt</li>
Install a layer of roofing felt which will act as the base of the new shingles. This waterproof membrane is an important part of the process. It will prevent
moisture penetration when it rains. The absence of a roofing felt will promote plant growth and may shorten your roof's lifespan.
Make sure that the roofing felt strips slightly overlap each other. To finish it off, secure it with a nail or staple gun.
 <li>Step #4: Draw chalk lines</li>
Using a chalk, draw lines to mark areas where you will place new shingles. Do not forget to measure from end to end for accuracy. In completing this step,
take your time and aim for clear precise lines.
The look of your new shingles lies on how carefully you have placed the markings. If done improperly, it might affect the overall look of your roof which
is the opposite of what you want to achieve. In simpler terms, it will not look good.
 <li>Step #5: Prepare your new shingles</li>
By the time you are finished marking the areas, you will be able to determine the number of shingles needed to replace old ones. Prepare the shingles for
installation by removing the tabs using a knife.
 <li>Step #6: Install the shingles</li>
When you are finally ready to lay the shingles, start by centering the first piece over the line markings. Afterwards, secure it with nails on each corner.
Place the next shingle beside it until the first row of shingles is filled. Repeat the process for other areas of your roof.

<h4 id="where-to-start"> Where do you start?</h4>

<p>
When performing a re-shingling project, the first step is to know the type of material that you will be working on. Of course, you need to match it with
the previously installed roofing system. If you change your mind and want a different roofing system, it will be a case for replacement.

In terms of cost and duration of the project, it varies depending on the size of your roof and choice of material. If it is more complicated to install,
then it would take longer.
</p>
<h4>Here is a quick rundown of the different types of roofing shingles:</h4>
<ul class="a">
<li><b>Asphalt-based shingle:</b> It is durable (can last up to 15 to 30 years), attractive, and eco-friendly. However, its protective granules may dislodge and
decay due to harsh weather conditions. It also least expensive costing only about $1 to $4 per square foot.</li>
<li>Slate: Made from traditional stones, these are durable, long-lasting, and fireproof. They are expensive and difficult to install but could, later on,
increase your property's resale value. There is also an option to go for synthetic slates which are more lightweight and less expensive.
<li>Wood: It is rust-proof, long-lasting, and classic. Treatments are needed to prevent infestations. It costs more or less $7 per square foot.
<li>Solar: Labor and materials are a huge long-term investment. In fact, it costs as much as $21 per square foot. However, solar shingles could lower electricity costs up to 60%.</li>
<li>Copper: As a metal composition, this is highly wind and fire resistant. It can decrease energy cost but could not filter external noise. This is also on the pricier side at it costs more or less $15 per square foot.</li>
<li>Fiberglass: This is lightweight and cost-effective ($4 to $5 per square foot). However, they are less durable than other types.</li>
 </ul>

<!--------------------------------------------------------->
<p>Important safety reminders
I cannot emphasize enough how risky this task is. Aside from being difficult, you need to have the right skills to implement the re-shingling correctly.
For starters, read about the safety measures you need to keep in mind and abide by these measure to stay protected at all times.
</p>
<body>
Wear proper attire complete with safety gears.
Handle nail/staple gun properly. Keep it away from your body and always unplug/disconnect when not in use.
Mount the ladder on an even surface and rest it against a solid structure. Make sure there are no debris or obstructions lying around that may move the ladder.
Do not carry too many tools as it may strain your back. Bring handy tools and avoid taking materials that you do not need.
Be mindful of your surroundings. Check if there are people passing by who might get hit by falling debris. It is also helpful to put a signage to warn other people that there is an ongoing construction.
Take caution at all times because a roofing job is risky and difficult.

 </ul>
 <br>

 <h4>1. Understanding the Basic Patterns</h4>
  You'll get the most life out of your shingles and your roof by laying them in a smart pattern. The basic straight up pattern already described is perhaps the easiest and most commonly used, but professional roofers have different opinions about the most proper and efficient method of laying the shingles to get the most life out of them, which differ slightly in the amount of overlap and the pattern in which you install them.
 The basic patterns include:
<ul class="a">
<li>the straight-up pattern</li>
<li>the half pattern</li>
<li>4-inch offset</li>
<li>5-inch offset</li>
</ul>
<br>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41387907/120051730-9a71fc00-bfd6-11eb-9311-2b1fbac19c3c.png" alt="Stagger to achieve 1/2 pattern" width=50% height=50%>
<br><br>
 <h4>2. Stagger each course to achieve the half pattern.</h4>
All the other patterns work in essentially the same way, offsetting the courses by a particular amount. For the 6-inch or "half" offset, you can protect butt joints and horizontally-moving water by starting a new course 6-inches in every row. Every seventh course, the butt joints will realign and offer stability and protection.
<br><br>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41387907/120051762-d1481200-bfd6-11eb-951d-c8931de20417.png" alt="4 inch & 5 inch offsets for added protection" width=50% length=50%>
<br><br>
<h4>3. Consider four and five inch offsets for added protection.</h4>
The method is exactly the same, though the measurement of the offset is slightly different. In an offset of four inches, standard shingles will realign every ten courses, while the five inch offsets will realign every eight. Understanding the benefits of each will help you decide which method to use for your roof:
The short overlap of the four inch offset is somewhat easier, allowing you to use cutouts to overlap every two courses, making less work for you. Unfortunately, because of this, the pattern is less desirable for extremely cold climates or very wet places.
For most DIY roofers, the five-inch offset is the most desirable pattern. It offers the most protection per shingle, making it much less likely that runoff will cut through the in-betweens, hiding shingle irregularities, and getting the most bang for your buck.

<br><br>
<h4>4. Consider "racking" shingles until you reach the top on each side.</h4>
The racking technique uses two sizes of the first shingle of each row, the regular 3 tab pieces and shortened pieces for each end, working vertically rather than horizontally. It goes much faster, allowing you to keep your tools next to you as you work and avoiding having to constantly reposition.

Racking shingles sometimes also may create a condition called "pattern curling," where the shingles curl and blow in the wind, at the places where the racked columns join, because of lifting the end of a shingle to place the next shingle and lifting the end high enough to nail the next shingle underneath each of the overlapping shingles. This curling may lead to water getting under shingles, leaking at the places where racked columns meet.
<br>
In some cases, racking may void the manufacturer's warranty on the expected leak-proofing quality and useful life of some brands of shingles. It's a common practice among contractors.

<h4>Shingle Type Recommendations for Re-Roofing Asphalt Shingles</h4>

The heavier the shingle on the new layer, the less likely it is that irregularities in the surface below will telegraph through.

Heavy as in 360 weight per square.  200 is low end.
And for Ellensburg winds,
<ul class="a">
<li>Class "H" - 150mph</li>
<li>Class "G" - 120mph, or</li>
<li>Class "D" - 90mph</li>
</ul>

Laminated or other heavy-textured shingles work well, as they do not need to be carefully fitted to the existing shingles, and the irregular texture will conceal any small bumps or dips from the original roof.
<br>
<h4>Prep Work for Re-Roofing Over Asphalt Shingles</h4>
Inspect the condition of the existing roof and roof deck for numer of roof layers, soundness of roof decking, smoothness of existing roof
installation, and other factors that determine whether or not you can do a roof-over or if a roof shingle tear-off is required.

<h3>Roof Drip Edge Flashing Requirements</h3>

<h4>Roof Drip Edge Flashing at Roof Eaves & Gable Ends</h4>

<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41387907/120088253-95c74980-c0a3-11eb-8d3c-1265baff52c3.png"
alt="Roof Drip Edge Flashing at Roof Eaves & Gable Ends" width=25% height=40%>
<br>
<p>
Roof drip edge flashing serves multiple functions on a building, the foremost of which is to assist water in leaving the roof edge with minimum damage to other building components by directing the water off of the roof and into the gutter.

Without this detail water leaving the roof edge wants to run down building fascias, soffits, and walls, sometimes even entering and damaging the structure.

The drip edge also gives us a nice straight edge with which to align roof shingles, slates or other roofing material.

Drip edge varies in dimensions but typically the flange that nails to the roof surface is about 2.5" wide and the vertical edge that directs roof
runoff down and away is about 1.5" in depth.

Lengths of drip vary but typically it's sold in ten foot lengths (120").

The sketch above illustrates the end-profile of roof drip edge flashing and shows its placement on the roof. Usually you won't see much of drip edge
as it's under the roof shingles, under the underlayment, and behind the roof gutter.

<h4>Starter Course for Re-Roofing Asphalt Shingles</h4>
<p>
It is important to nest the new shingles against the old to create a flat surface.<br>

This process starts with a 5-inch starter strip fit along the eaves and set against the second course of existing shingles.
</p>
<br>
<!------ ![image](Chttps://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41387907/120084914-1167cd00-c089-11eb-8f4a-5c6ba0470ae5.png) ------>

DF Notes:
<mark>
Notice that in re-roofing the starter strip is an inch less in width than when installing new shingles over
a fresh roof-deck, shown in our asphalt shingle roofing guide at ASPHALT SHINGLE STARTER COURSE INSTALLATION.
</mark>
<p>
That's to avoid a raised ridge and to let the new full shingle course lay flat atop the original shingles.
In essence when I [DJF] installed shingles over an existing roof, for maximum roof life I want the shingles
to lay flat - raised ridges in asphalt shingle mean bending that means wear that means shorter shingle life.
</p>
So the upper edge of each new shingle course butts against the lower edge of the appropriate existing shingles on the roof above the course being installed. That will let the shingles lay flat on the roof. <br>
Only the first course needs support below - that's why we cut a special starter strip of more-narrow width than for a new roof installation.
<br>
The special starter strip width is equal to the exposure width (usually 5") of the existing roof.
<br>
Even before installing the starter strip or underlayment you should install drip edge flashing along all roof edges.

See DRIP EDGE FLASHING for ROOFS

Next install a course of shingles cut down to 10 inches wide, so they fit against the bottom edge of the existing third
course (this creates a new 3-inch first course). After that, shingling should proceed normally, fitting each course up
against the bottom of an existing course.
<br>
<h5>Fastening / Nailing Details When Re-Roofing with Asphalt Shingles</h5>
Use galvanized roofing nails long enough to fully penetrate the sheathing, typically 1-1/2 inches for a second roof and 1 3/4 inches for a
third. Nesting each new row below an existing one keeps the new nails 2 inches below the existing, which will help minimize any splitting of the sheathing.
Flashings for Re-Roofing Asphalt Shingles
<br>
Depending on their condition and accessibility, some flashings can be reused. New shingles may be able to tuck under existing step flashing,
chimney flashings, and front-wall flashings. If they are deteriorated, they must be replaced along with vent boots.
<br>
See FLASHING ROOF WALL DETAILS and FLASHING ROOF-WALL SNAFU for specifications of roof-wall flashing and for some photo-examples of troubles
with existing step and counter flashing when re-roofing an existing structure.
Valley Details for Re-Roofing Asphalt Shingles
<br>
Any type of valley flashing will work and simply lays over the existing flashing (except in a tear-off, where all flashings should be replaced).
<br>
Unless a metal valley flashing is used, the first step is to line the existing valley with a new underlayment consisting of either 90-pound roll roofing or
a more durable modified bitumen membrane. Then install either a closed or woven valley as described above.

Within asphalt, there's a lot to consider.
<br>
<h5>Start by looking at shingle types, including </h5>
<ul class="a">
<li><b>three-tab</b>,</li>
<li>architectural, and </li>
<li>multilayered</li>
</ul>
In our recent strength tests on products from six manufacturers, we found that the most costly type multilayered architectural shingles, typically with
three to four layers that overlap generally performs better overall than other styles.
But our testing also revealed lower-cost options with fewer layers that still perform admirably. On most homes, a top-performing three-tab, which has
only one layer, or architectural laminated shingles will work just fine, says Misha Kollontai, who leads CR tests of roofing products.
What's more, you can find savings among similarly rated multilayered architectural laminated shingles. For instance, Iko Crowne Slate costs $180 per
100 square feet a standard roofing quantity compared with CertainTeed Presidential Shake at $325. That's an 81 percent price difference for similar performance.

<h3 id="asphalt-shingles">3-Tab Asphalt vs. Over-Price Architectural - Wikipedia</h3>

Architectural or 3-Tab
Asphalt Shingles come in two standard design options: Architectural (also known as Dimensional) Shingles, and 3-Tab Shingles. 3-Tab are essentially flat simple shingles with a uniform shape and size. They use less material and are thinner than Architectural Shingles, and are therefore lighter and lower cost for both the material and the installation. They also do not last as long or offer Manufacturer's Warranties as long as good architectural asphalt shingles. 3-Tab are still the most commonly installed in lower-value homes, such as those used as rental properties. However, they are declining in popularity in favor of the architectural style. Dimensional, or architectural shingles are thicker and stronger, vary in shape and size, and offer more aesthetic appeal; casting more distinct, random shadow lines better mimics the appearance of traditional roofing materials such as wood shake shingles.[7] The result is a more natural, traditional look. While more expensive to install, they come with longer manufacturer's warranties, sometimes up to 50 Years - typically prorated, as virtually all asphalt shingle roofs are replaced before such an expiration could be reached. While 3-tab shingles typically need to be replaced after 15–18 years, Dimensional typically last 24–30 years.

<h4 id="how-to-lay-shingles">How to Lay Shingles</h4>

<ol class="g">
  <li>Size your shingles appropriately.</li>
Depending on how you're going to organize your rows and courses, some roofers like to cut five variable sizes of shingles when using the
basic three-tab variety. Basically, you'll cut off one-half tab-width of the first tab to start the first course, changing the necessary area to fill with each row, shifting the "slots."
<br>
Usually, the following cuts are useful:
  <ul class="a">
   <li>A half tab off for your first course shingles,</li>
   <li>A full tab for your second course shingles</li>
   <li>1.5 tabs off of your third course shingles,</li>
   <li>2 tabs off your fourth course shingles</li>
   <li>For your fifth course, cut off half of the final tab</li>
   <li>Keep your sixth course tabs intact</li>
  </ul>
<br>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41387907/120050966-9a243180-bfd3-11eb-9048-77f382016542.png" alt="Lay starting row at bottom of roof along the edge" width=75% height=75%>
<br><br>
  <li>Lay a starting row at the bottom of the roof along the edge.</li>
Place nails in the three tab shingles about 3/4 inch (1.8 centimeters) above the cutouts, near where the tab meets the upper part of the shingle. However, make sure that you do not nail into the tar strip. Also place a nail 2 inches from each end of the shingle, in line with the other two. In all, use four nails per 3-tab shingle.
Nailing here will cause the next shingle to cover the nail heads and allow the next and subsequent rows of nails in shingles to always penetrate and hold the top edge of the lower row (this allows 8 nails to hold each shingle).
If the nail gun is firing too deeply, almost mashing through the shingles, then the nails will soon pull through and come loose. Set the air compressor and gun depth setting lower.
<br><br>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41387907/120050918-6e08b080-bfd3-11eb-8fe5-f01534773798.png" alt="Lay 1st row of shingles" width=75% height=75%>
<br><br>
  <li>Lay the first row of shingles directly covering the narrow starter row.</li>
Snap a horizontal chalk line over the starting row to use as a guide.[2] Cut six inches off the length of the first starter shingle nailed on, then use the rest of them full size. Shifting them in this way will join the ends of the first regular row of shingles placed over the starter shingles. This is the basic, sometimes called "straight up" way of laying shingles.
For the kind of shingles you purchase there may be a special starter row of shingles or a roll of strip material that you cut to the length of your roof.
Alternatively, you can use a starting row of full-sized shingles by turning them with the tabs pointing upward.
<br><br>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41387907/120051009-cf308400-bfd3-11eb-9438-be647e7e5453.png" alt="Lay 2nd row of shingles" width=75% height=75%>
<br><br>
<li>Lay the second row of shingles.</li>
Set the first shingle of the second row back a half tab, 6 inches (17 centimeters), from the edge of first shingle on the first row and so that the bottom of its tabs just touches the tops of the cutout slots on the shingle below. This 1/2 tab has to be cut off where it hangs off the left edge of the gable roof.
Snap a vertical chalk line from the inside edge of the first shingle on the second row to the top of the roof, and from the inside edge of the first shingle to the top of the roof. These chalk lines will serve as a guide for subsequent even-numbered rows of shingles, and odd-numbered rows, respectively. Continue working horizontally up the roof until you reach the peaks.
<br><br>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41387907/120051039-ee2f1600-bfd3-11eb-8038-8b331a310805.png" alt="Shingle around stacks, vents & chimneys as needed" width=75% heigth=75%>
<br><br>
<li>Shingle around stacks, vents and chimneys as necessary.</li>
Nail pieces of aluminum sheeting over holes that you can stick your finger through to protect roofing over holes from sagging, dimpling, cracking and leaking.
Stack pipes, vents and chimneys are surrounded with metal flashing laid over tar. Shingles should be interlaced with this flashing, which is usually cemented and nailed-down under upper shingles, but over the shingles on the sides. This is so water will run down the roof but not under the interlacing. For stacks and vents, have the bottom 2 or 3 rows that meet the flashing go under it, while the upper rows go over the flashing.
<br><br>
<img src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41387907/120051079-17e83d00-bfd4-11eb-8dd9-72e3edfd1578.png" alt="Interlace the flashing around chimney with rows of shingles" width=75% height=75%>
<br><br>
  <li>Interlace the flashing around the chimney with the rows of shingles.</li>
Cement a sheet metal flashing apron over the upper edge of the chimney flange before laying shingles over it and cement another flashing apron over the lower half. Then cover the lower apron on each cemented side layer of flashing that tucks under the top apron using asphalt roofing cement.
<br><br>

<br><br>
<li>Bring the ridge edges together with a ridge-capping layer.</li>
You can either use special shingles called ridge shingles or cut a number of regular shingles into 3 tabbed, equal pieces and bend each so they fit snugly on the roof peak and nail them into place. You'll need longer nails for this part, as you're driving through more layers of shingles.

<h3 id="organic-fiberglass">Wikipedia - Organic or Fiberglass?</h3>
Two types of base materials are used to make asphalt shingles, organic and fiberglass. Both are made in a similar manner, with an asphalt-saturated base covered on one or both sides with asphalt or modified-asphalt, the exposed surface impregnated with slate, schist, quartz, vitrified brick, stone,[6] or ceramic granules, and the under-side treated with sand, talc or mica to prevent shingles from sticking to one-another before use.

The top surface granules block ultra-violet light, which causes the shingles to deteriorate, provides some physical protection of the asphalt core, and provides color – lighter shades preferred for their heat reflectivity in sunny climates, darker in cooler ones for their absorption. Some shingles have copper or other biocides added to the surface to help prevent algae growth. Self-sealing strips are standard on the underside of shingles to provide resistance to lifting in high winds. This material is typically limestone or fly-ash-modified resins, or polymer-modified bitumen. American Society of Civil Engineers ASTM D7158 is the standard most United States residential building codes use as their wind resistance standard for most discontinuous, steep-slope roof coverings (including asphalt shingles) with the following class ratings: Class D – Passed at basic wind speeds up to and including 90 mph; Class G – Passed at basic wind speeds up to and including 120 mph; and Class H – Passed at basic wind speeds up to and including 150 mph. An additive known as styrene-butadiene-styrene (SBS), sometimes called modified or rubberized asphalt, is sometimes added to the asphalt mixture to make shingles more pliable, resistant to thermal cracking, and more resistant to damage from hail impacts. Some manufacturers use a fabric backing known as a scrim on the back side of shingles to make them more impact resistant. Most insurance companies offer discounts to homeowners for using Class 4 impact rated shingles.
<br>
<h5>Organic</h5>
Organic shingles are made with a base mat of organic materials such as waste paper, cellulose, wood fiber, or other materials. This is saturated with asphalt to make it waterproof, then a top coating of adhesive asphalt is applied, covered with solid granules. Such shingles contain around 40% more asphalt per square (100 sq ft.) than fiberglass shingles. Their organic core leaves them more prone to fire damage, resulting in a maximum class "B" FM fire rating. They are also less brittle than fiberglass shingles in cold weather.

The early wood material-based versions were very durable and hard to tear, an important quality before self-sealing materials were added to the underside of shingles to bond them to the layer beneath. Also, some organic shingles produced before the early 1980s may contain asbestos.
<br>
<h5>Fiberglass</h5>
Fiberglass reinforcement was devised as the replacement for asbestos in organic mat shingles. Fiberglass shingles have a base layer of glass fiber reinforcing mat made from wet, random-laid glass fibers bonded with urea-formaldehyde resin. The mat is then coated with asphalt containing mineral fillers to make it waterproof. Such shingles resist fire better than those with organic/paper mats, making them eligible for as high as a class "A" rating. Weight typically ranges from 1.8 to 2.3 pounds/square foot.

Fiberglass shingles gradually began to replace organic felt shingles, and by 1982 overtook them in use. Widespread hurricane damage in Florida during the 1990s prompted the industry to adhere to a 1700-gram tear value on finished asphalt shingles[citation needed].

Per 2003 International Building Code Sections 1507.2.1 and 1507.2.2, asphalt shingles shall only be used on roof slopes of two units vertical in 12 units horizontal (17% slope) or greater. Asphalt shingles shall be fastened to solidly sheathed decks. Shallower slopes require asphalt rolled roofing, or other roofing treatment.

<!--------------------------------------------------------->
<h3 id="disposal-recycle">Disposal and Recycling</h3>

<h5>Disposal methods</h5>
According to a 2007 study conducted for the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), approximately 11 million tons of asphalt shingle waste is generated each year in the United States, with the most common disposal method being landfilling.[15] Waste asphalt shingles do, however, offer the potential to be recycled.

<h5>Recycling</h5>
Reclaimed asphalt shingles (RAS) can be broken down and incorporated into asphalt concrete mixtures, which are used to form pavements and road surfaces. RAS are an attractive component in recycled asphalt mixes, primarily due to their relatively high content of asphalt cement,[16] which acts as the binding element in asphalt concrete.[17]

There are two forms of RAS: post-manufacturer shingles that are reclaimed from factory waste, and post-consumer shingles that are reclaimed at the end of their service life (also referred to as “tear-offs”).[18] The majority of asphalt shingle waste is post-consumer.[15] Post-consumer RAS have fewer appealing properties for recycling, primarily because the asphalt cement component in shingles naturally hardens during its service life, resulting in higher stiffness, melting point, and susceptibility to fatigue cracking.[16][18] Post-consumer RAS also require additional processing, such as the removal of nails and other metal waste through the use of a magnetic sieve.[18]

Recycled asphalt mixtures may contain post-manufacture and/or post-consumer RAS, provided that the quality of the asphalt cement binder is accessed and accounted for. Aged binders are typically combined with soft virgin asphalt binder and/or rejuvenating additives to produce a binder that is workable and resistant to fatigue cracking.[16][18] Standard practice for accessing the binder quality in RAS and blending it with virgin binder has been established by The American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO).[19] When RAS binder is combined with low-grade virgin binder, it has been demonstrated to provide some beneficial properties, such as increased resistance to rutting.[15] [16]

In 2019, an estimated 1.1 million tons of RAS were accepted by asphalt plants. Of those accepted, approximately 423 thousand tons were pre-processed, 334 thousand tons were unprocessed post-manufacturer shingles, and 277 thousand tons were unprocessed post-consumer shingles.[20]
